Contao Turbo Helper
===================

This extension helps with the usage of Turbo in Contao applications.

* It provides a Turbo Frame wrapper as content elements.
* It forces the status code to 422 Unprocessable Entity when a Contao form does not validate.
* It forces a JavaScript load of a form's target URL, in case it would redirect to a URL outside the current domain.
